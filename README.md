# Tourly Agency 
Created by ZUKSKY

Welcome to the **Tourly Agency** project! This is a modern web application built using React and Vite, designed for a travel agency.

## Project Purpose

This project was created as a learning exercise to convert static HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript into a dynamic React application using Vite. The goal is to gain hands-on experience with React's component-based architecture and to understand how to integrate modern development tools like Vite for fast and efficient builds.
